# HTML_JS_PHP_Facebook_Like_Page
A "facebook" page that has some functionalities. 

For the study of PHP I used EasyPHP Devserver.

The usernames and passwords that work for having results in the LogInPage.html are : 
    
      username : "george"
      password : "1234"
      ,
      username : "maria"
      password : "test"
